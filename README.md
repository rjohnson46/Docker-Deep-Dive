# 🐳 DockerDeepDive

## 📖 Overview
**Notes from the book:**  
*Docker Deep Dive – ZERO TO DOCKER IN A SINGLE BOOK!* by **Nigel Poulton**

---

## 🎯 Purpose
I wanted to take notes and document my **learning journey** with **Docker**, and eventually **Kubernetes** as well.  
This repository will serve as a structured space to map out each chapter with:
- 💡 Key concepts  
- 📝 Personal thoughts  
- 📚 Useful information  

---

## ⚙️ Learning Path
- **Docker** → Understanding containers, images, networking, and orchestration.  
- **Kubernetes** → Expanding into container orchestration and scaling.  

---

## 📂 Structure
Each chapter will include:
1. **Summary of concepts**  
2. **Commands or examples**  
3. **Personal insights**  
4. **References for deeper study**  

---

## 🚀 Goal
By documenting this journey, I aim to:
- Reinforce my own learning  
- Share knowledge with others exploring Docker & Kubernetes  
- Build a practical reference guide for future projects
